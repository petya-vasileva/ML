    "### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of that lab is to compare 2 versions of the \"Path changed\" alarms, both of which look for unusual ASNs in the traceroute tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first version is a step-by-step algorithm following rules derived by observations over a long period of time. The second verion uses Autoencoder which tries to reconstrunct the ASN sequnces and then looks for anomalies based on the recostruction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is analyse the results of the 2 methods and use the best for generation alarms in the future.\n",
    "\n",
